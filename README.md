# ultimate-tictactoe

## About
This is my implementation of Ultimate tic-tac-toe using Java. I Used Java's Swing API to create the GUI.

## Execution
Make sure that JDK is installed. In a terminal, type `javac TicTacToeStarter.java` to compile the java files into bytecode (.class files), then `java TicTacToeStarter` to execute the program.
