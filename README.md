# ultimate-tictactoe

## About
This is my implementation of Ultimate tic-tac-toe using Java. I Used Java's Swing API to create the GUI.

## Execution
Make sure that [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html) is installed. Clone this repository. In a terminal, navigate to the directory named ultimate-tictactoe (the parent directory of ultimatetictactoe) and run `javac ultimatetictactoe/TicTacToeStarter.java` to compile the java files into bytecode (.class files), then `java ultimatetictactoe/TicTacToeStarter` to execute the program.
